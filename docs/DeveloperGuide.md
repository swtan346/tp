## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section contains some noteworthy details on how certain features are being implemented.

### Adding a patient into Nursing Address Book

#### Implementation

The add patient feature is facilitated mainly by `AddCommand`, `AddCommandParser` and `LogicManager`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add patient feature behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user inputs an add Command (e.g. `add n\Alice ic\A0055679T ad\01/01/2022 dob\01/01/2002 w\WA`) to add a new patient named Alice to the address book.  

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The format of the add command is as follows:  
  
- **n\\**: Indicates the name of the patient  
- **ic\\**: Indicates the NRIC of the patient  
- **ad\\**: Indicates the admission date of the patient into the hospital  
- **dob\\**: Indicates the date of birth of the patient  
- **w\\**: Indicates the ward the patient is currently in  
- **r\\**: Indicates remarks for the patient (optional)  
- **t\\**: Indicates the tags of the patient (optional, can have multiple)    
</div>


**Step 2.** The command is parsed via `AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`, which calls `AddCommandParser#parse(String)` to parse the user input and creates a new `AddCommand` object.

**Step 3.** The created `AddCommand` is returned to `LogicManager`. Then, `AddCommand` is executed by calling `AddCommand#execute(Model)`.

**Step 4.** The `AddCommand#execute(Model)` then calls `Model#addPerson(Person)` to add the new patient to the address book.

**Step 5.** The `CommandResult` from the `AddCommand` object is returned to `LogicManager` and then to `UI` to display the success message.

**UML Diagrams:**

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![AddSequenceDiagram.png](images%2FAddSequenceDiagram.png)


The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![AddActivityDiagram.png](images%2FAddActivityDiagram.png)

### Deleting a patient from Nursing Address Book

#### Implementation

The delete patient feature is facilitated mainly by `DeleteCommand`, `DeleteCommandParser` and `LogicManager`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete patient feature behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user inputs a delete Command (e.g. `delete 1`) to delete the patient at index 1 in Nursing Address Book.

**Step 2.** The command is parsed via `AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`, which calls `DeleteCommandParser#parse(String)` to parse the user input and creates a new `DeleteCommand` object.

**Step 3.** The created `DeleteCommand` is returned to `LogicManager`. Then, `DeleteCommand` is executed by calling `DeleteCommand#execute(Model)`.

**Step 4.** The `DeleteCommand#execute(Model)` then calls `Model#deletePerson(Person)` to delete the patient from the address book.

**Step 5.** The `CommandResult` from the `DeleteCommand` object is returned to `LogicManager` and then to `UI` to display the success message.

**UML Diagrams:**

Given below is the sequence diagram that summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![DeleteSequenceDiagram.png](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![DeleteActivityDiagram.png](images/DeleteActivityDiagram.png)

### Editing a patient's details

#### Implementation

Editing a patient's details is facilitated mainly by `EditCommand`, `EditCommandParser` and `LogicManager`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit patient feature behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user inputs an edit Command (e.g. `edit 1 w\WB`) to edit the ward of the patient at index 1 in Nursing Address Book.

**Step 2.** The command is parsed via `AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`, which calls `EditCommandParser#parse(String)`to parse the user input and creates a new `EditCommand` object.

**Step 3.** A new `EditPersonDescriptor` object is created with the new ward details. 
A new `EditCommand` instance will be created with the index of the patient to be edited and the new `EditPersonDescriptor` object.

**Step 4.** The `EditCommand` instance is returned to the `LogicManager` and `execute` is called.

**Step 5.** The `EditCommand` instance calls `Model#setPerson(Person, Person)` to edit the patient's details.
The patient specified will have its ward updated to the new ward specified.

**UML Diagrams:**

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

### Showing help for commands

#### Implementation

Showing help for commands is facilitated by the `HelpCommand` class. It allows users to view the usage instructions for the application.

The following class diagram shows the structure of the `HelpCommand` class:

![HelpCommandClassDiagram](images/HelpClassDiagram.png)

The `HelpCommand` class interacts with the following components:

* `Logic`: The `HelpCommand` class is part of the `Logic` component and is executed by the `LogicManager` when the user enters the `help` command.
* `UI`: The `MainWindow` class in the `UI` component subscribes to the `CommandResult` event raised by the `HelpCommand` and displays the help message in the `HelpWindow`.


The `HelpCommand` class extends the `Command` interface and implements the `execute()` method. When the `help` command is executed, the `HelpCommand#execute()` method is called, which creates a `CommandResult` object with the help message to be displayed to the user.

Here are the steps involved when a user calls the `help` command:

**Step 1.** The user enters the `help` command in the CLI.

**Step 2.** The `LogicManager` receives the command and calls the `parseCommand()` method of the `AddressBookParser`.

**Step 3.** The `AddressBookParser` identifies the command as a `HelpCommand` and creates a new instance of the `HelpCommand` class.

**Step 4.** The `AddressBookParser` returns the `HelpCommand` instance to the `LogicManager`.

**Step 5.** The `LogicManager` calls the `execute()` method of the `HelpCommand` instance.

**Step 6.** The `HelpCommand#execute()` method creates a new `CommandResult` object with the help message.

**Step 7.** The `CommandResult` object is returned to the `LogicManager`.

**Step 8.** The `LogicManager` passes the `CommandResult` to the `MainWindow` for display.

**Step 9.** The `MainWindow` extracts the help message from the `CommandResult` and displays it in the `HelpWindow`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the help command works:
![HelpCommandSequenceDiagram](images/HelpSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Displaying the help message**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Display the help message in a separate window.
    * Pros: Allows the user to view the help message without navigating away from the main window.
    * Cons: Requires additional implementation to create and manage a separate help window.

* **Alternative 2**: Display the help message in the main window's result display.
    * Pros: Simpler implementation, as it reuses the existing result display component.
    * Cons: The help message may be obscured by subsequent command results, and the user may need to scroll to view the entire message.

**Aspect: Providing command-specific help**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Provide a general help message that covers all commands.
    * Pros: Simplifies the implementation and maintains a consistent help message format.
    * Cons: The user may need to read through the entire help message to find information about a specific command.

* **Alternative 2**: Provide command-specific help messages.
    * Pros: Allows users to quickly access help information for a particular command.
    * Cons: Requires additional implementation to map each command to its specific help message, and may lead to inconsistencies in the help message format.

#### Future enhancements

Here are some possible enhancements for the help feature:

* Implement context-sensitive help that provides guidance based on the user's current input or state.
* Add support for displaying rich media content, such as images or videos, to provide more engaging and informative help content.
* Integrate a search functionality within the help system to allow users to quickly find relevant information.

These enhancements would improve the user experience and make the help feature more interactive and user-friendly.


### List by tags and/or ward feature

#### Implementation

The filter by tags and/or ward mechanism is facilitated by `ListCommand`, `ListCommandParser`, `ListKeywordsPredicate`
and `LogicManager`, which implements the `Logic` interface. `LogicManager` holds a `AddressBookParser` that parses the 
user input, and a model where the command is executed. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `LogicManager#execute(String)`— Executes the given user String input to return a `CommandResult` object.

These operations are exposed in the UI interface as `MainWindow#executeCommand(String)`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the filter by tags and/or ward mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `list t\diabetes` command to list patients with the diabetes tag in the address book. 
- The `list` command triggers `AddressBookParser` to parse the user input, identifying the `list` command word to call
`ListCommandParser#parse(String)` to parse the rest of the user input.

Step 2. `ListCommandParser#parse(String)` parses the user input. If there are subsequent arguments, a 
`ListKeywordPredicate` object is created with the keyword(s) provided. The keywords can be either a ward or tag(s) or both,
supplied by the user with the relevant prefix. In this case, it would be a tag, `t\diabetes`.

Step 3. A new `ListCommand` instance is created using the `ListKeywordsPredicate` object. (If there are no parameters 
provided, it will still simply create a `ListCommand` object.)

The following is a list of objects created thus far:
![ListObjectDiagram](images/ListObjectDiagram.png)

Step 4. The `ListCommand` object is returned to `LogicManager` and `execute` is called. `ListCommand#execute(Model)` 
filters the list of patients in `Model` based on the `ListKeywordsPredicate` object if it is present. (Otherwise, it 
returns the full list of patients.)

Step 5. The filtered list of patients (with diabetes) is displayed to the user through the GUI.

**UML Diagrams:**

The following sequence diagram shows how the listing of relevant patients would work:
![ListCommandSequenceDiagram](images/ListCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command to list relevant patients:

<img src="images/ListCommandActivityDiagram2.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Command to filter:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add the parameters to list command instead of find.
    * Pros: More appropriate as `list` will produce a useful list of relevant contacts, whereas `find` implies that only one useful result is expected.
    * Cons: May not have such a clear distinction between `list` and `find`, as user just wants to search for results.

* **Alternative 2:** Add parameters to find command instead of list.
    * Pros: Easy to use, one command will perform all search.
    * Cons: Unable to differentiate usefulness.

**Aspect: Filter by a ward or many wards:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow filtering only by at most 1 ward input.
    * Pros: More targeted; Nurses will only refer to the ward that they are in or are visiting. Otherwise, will filter across all wards.
    * Cons: Does not allow looking at specific, multiple wards.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow multiple ward tags.
    * Pros: Easy to be more specific.
    * Cons: Not relevant for the nurses use case. Allowing more wards also make it harder to filter fast.

### Find feature

#### Introduction
This section describes the implementation of the find by name or NRIC mechanism in NAB. 

#### Implementation

The find feature is facilitated by `FindCommand`, `FindCommandParser`, `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` and
`IcContainsKeywordsPredicate`.

Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `FindCommandParser#parse()` — Parses user input and creates a `FindCommand` object.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find by name or IC mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `find n\Bob` command to find patient with the name Bob in the address book. The
`FindCommandParser` parses the user input, creating a new `FindCommand` and `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object.

Step 2. For each patient in the address book, the `predicate` object will be passed to
`Model#updateFilteredPersonList` check if the patient has Bob as part of his/her name. If the patient has the name Bob,
the patient will be shown in result.

**UML Diagrams:**

The following sequence diagram shows how the finding of patient would work:
![FindCommandSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command to find a patient:

![FindActivityDiagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Find by full word or letters:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow finding by full word only.
    * Pros: More meaningful to find by words instead of just letters.
    * Cons: Harder to search when patient details is insufficient.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow finding by letters.
    * Pros: Able to search even if lacking patient information.
    * Cons: Harder to get specific patient as result will be a list.
